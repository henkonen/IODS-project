# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R Markdown syntax.*

I am feeling **really excited** about _this course_, but at the same time __a little__ bit overwhelmed because of many things going on at work ~~adn~~ and studies.  I would expect to learn coding with R and hopefully^if_I_manage_to_take_time_for_this^ learn to use it for my own purposes. I heard about the course from a colleague.

###Link

Here is a link to my GitHub repository: [link](https://github.com/henkonen/IODS-project).  
And here is it written out: https://github.com/henkonen/IODS-project

```{r}
paste("Hello", "World!")
```

`r paste("Hello world!")`

```{r highlight=TRUE}
paste("Hello", "World!")
```
